Hi there! I'm a Bachelor of Software Engineering graduate from the University of Sydney, currently pursuing a Master of Computer Science degree in the University of Melbourne. 

Most of my time outside of my study had been dedicated to working part-time as a software engineer or developing the operating system for the Unimelb Rover Team. But I do have a few projects that I want to work on in the future!
